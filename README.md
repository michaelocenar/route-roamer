# RouteRoamer
Introducing RouteRoamer, an elegant and sophisticated web application designed to craft AI-curated travel itineraries tailored to your unique preferences. Delight in the convenience of discovering thoughtfully suggested activities, seamlessly integrated with Google Maps, to help you explore any destination across the globe with ease.

RouteRoamer was created using Next.js, OpenAI API, Google Maps API, MapboxAPI, and PostgreSQL. 

In the future, we plan to experiment with different AI models to reduce the response time from a minute to ideally <20 sdconds. We also aim to provide more detailed information about each location in the marker's infowindow in the map.
